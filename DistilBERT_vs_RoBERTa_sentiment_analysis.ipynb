      "I love sci-fi and am willing to put up with a lot. Sci-fi movies/TV are usually underfunded, under-appreciated and misunderstood. I tried to like this, I really did, but it is to good TV sci-fi as Babylon 5 is to Star Trek (the original). Silly prosthetics, cheap cardboard sets, stilted dialogues, CG that doesn't match the background, and painfully one-dimensional characters cannot be overcome with a 'sci-fi' setting. (I'm sure there are those of you out there who think Babylon 5 is good sci-fi TV. It's not. It's clich√©d and uninspiring.) While US viewers might like emotion and character development, sci-fi is a genre that does not take itself seriously (cf. Star Trek). It may treat important issues, yet not as a serious philosophy. It's really difficult to care about the characters here as they are not simply foolish, just missing a spark of life. Their actions and reactions are wooden and predictable, often painful to watch. The makers of Earth KNOW it's rubbish as they have to always say \"Gene Roddenberry's Earth...\" otherwise people would not continue watching. Roddenberry's ashes must be turning in their orbit as this dull, cheap, poorly edited (watching it without advert breaks really brings this home) trudging Trabant of a show lumbers into space. Spoiler. So, kill off a main character. And then bring him back as another actor. Jeeez! Dallas all over again.\n",

    "## 3. Measure Performance\n",
    "Implement an evaluation method on a test or validation split. At minimum:\n",
    "- Accuracy: The fraction of examples predicted correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- F1 Score: Combination of precision and recall. (explanation of this is given below, after the instructions)\n",
    "You can use the Hugging Face evaluate or datasets library or write your own small function for computing these metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### F1 Score Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you‚Äôre trying to detect ‚Äúpositive‚Äù cases‚Äîfor example, emails that are spam. Your model‚Äôs predictions might fall into these categories:\n",
    "- True Positive (TP): Predicted spam, actually spam\n",
    "- False Positive (FP): Predicted spam, but it‚Äôs not spam\n",
    "- True Negative (TN): Predicted not spam, actually not spam\n",
    "- False Negative (FN): Predicted not spam, but it was spam\n",
    "\n",
    "Two important measures come from this:\n",
    "- Precision: Out of the emails you labeled spam, how many were actually spam? Precision=TP/(TP + FP)‚Äã\n",
    "- Recall: Out of the emails that were actually spam, how many did you catch? Recall=TP‚Äã/(TP + FN)\n",
    "\n",
    "But often, focusing on just Precision or just Recall is not enough. The F1 score combines both in a single number. It‚Äôs defined as the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "F1=2√ó ((Precision√óRecall‚Äã)/(Precision+Recall))\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, if either Precision or Recall is low, the F1 score will also be relatively low.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example with a Small Confusion Matrix\n",
    "Suppose your model had these results:\n",
    "\n",
    "- TP = 4\n",
    "- FP = 2\n",
    "- FN = 1\n",
    "- TN = 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Precision=4/(4+2)‚Äã=0.66 (about 66%)\n",
    "- Recall=4/(4+1)‚Äã=0.80 (80%)\n",
    "\n",
    "So,\n",
    "F1=2√ó(0.66√ó0.80)/(0.66+0.80)‚Äã‚âà0.72\n",
    "\n",
    "Quick Python Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a short snippet using sklearn (you dont have to usethis, hugging face also has a f1 function) to calculate the F1 score from some example predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from sklearn.metrics import f1_score\n",
    "\n",
    "True labels and model predictions\n",
    "y_true = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]\n",
    "y_pred = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate F1 score\n",
    "score = f1_score(y_true, y_pred)\n",
    "print(\"F1 Score:\", score)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run this, you‚Äôll see a single value that summarizes how good your predictions are at correctly identifying positives (with both ‚Äúhow often you‚Äôre correct‚Äù in positives, and ‚Äúhow many positives you caught‚Äù taken into account).\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- F1 score balances Precision and Recall into one number.\n",
    "- If you need a single metric to judge performance in situations where both false positives and false negatives matter, F1 is often a good choice.\n",
    "- In Python, `sklearn.metrics.f1_score` makes it easy to compute."

You can tell Isaac has a real passion for the genre and his films are always eventful, creative and sharp affairs, with some of the best fight sequences an action fan could hope for. In particular he has found a muse with Scott Adkins, as talented an actor and action performer as you could hope for. This is borne out with Special Forces and Undisputed 2, but unfortunately The Shepherd just doesn't live up to their abilities.<br /><br />There is no doubt that JCVD looks better here fight-wise than he has done in years, especially in the fight he has (for pretty much no reason) in a prison cell, and in the final showdown with Scott, but look in his eyes.

You can't even laugh at the cheesy'ness.<br /><br />The directing and editing are also terrible, the whole film follows an extremely tired routine and fails at every turn as it bumbles through the plot that is so weak it's just unreal.<br /><br />There's not a lot else to say other than it's really bad and nothing like Jean-Claude Van Damme's earlier work which you could enjoy.<br /><br />Avoid like the plaque, frankly words fail me in condemning this \"film\".\n",
